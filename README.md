# MPRIS-rs-async
This is an async wrapper for certain types from [mpris-rs](https://github.com/Mange/mpris-rs). 
Currently this includes PlayerFinder/PlayerIter (as PlayerStream), PlayerEvents (as PlayerEventsStream), and ProgressTracker (as ProgressStream).

# This is very much experimental in its current phase. There are a lot of random DBus errors that I have gotten in testing and I have no idea why they occur.


## Also I'm not the best at rust and this is my first time making a library

Enjoy
